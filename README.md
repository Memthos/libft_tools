## Description

`libft_tools` is a lighter, optimized version of the libft library. It also includes implementations of `get_next_line` and `ft_printf`.

All functions are compiled into a static library (`libft_tools.a`) which can be used in other projects.

## Instructions

A `Makefile` is provided to compile the project.

**Build**
```bash
make
```

**Clean**
```bash
make clean
make fclean
```

**Rebuild**
```bash
make re
```

## Resources

This project was developed without the use of any AI tools.

The manual page references (`man`) were used to look at function specifications.  
The terminal has also been used as an example to see the functions comportments.
